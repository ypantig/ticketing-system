# Ticketing System
A ticketing system created for Atira Property Management site to manage requests created for strata buildings.

Each strata building is part of a multi-site and has their own requests handled by the ticketing system. Each ticket contains fields for the building name, the name of the person requesting for the service, the type of service, priority, as well as the subject and body.

A status on the ticket is updated each time a ticket has been newly created, and if a new update has been posted on the ticket. Users can create a conversation around each ticket, utilizing WordPress's comments functionality.

A ticket is only visible to the administrator of the site, as well as the person who had submitted the ticket.
